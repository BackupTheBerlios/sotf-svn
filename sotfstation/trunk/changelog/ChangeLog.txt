Overall page generation framework is now fully integrated together with the garbage collector.

Multilangiage support built in, which relies on the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANG global variable and will 
be by default set to english.

Error lang file has been introduced.

Failure of Local Database Connection will force the server down and spawn an error message. 
Failure in Remote Database Connection (SADM) will spawn an error message for the garbage collector.

PHP error handler has been overriden with custom error handling routines.

User Authentication runs through SADM, no matter whether it is on a local server or found remotely. 
In the latter case it will be accessed via XMLRPC. The two various access methods are seamless 
for the client and the best one should be choosen at setup time. Error reporting included.

No Access page has been defined and linked to appropriate authentication handling routines

Overall Navigation Menu has been linked with Access Parameters

HelpBox class created and database scheme designed to support it. Now any section of the 
website can easily get ondemand help. This is part of the main development framework and must
