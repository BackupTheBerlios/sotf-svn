  &#8226; An FTP Server.<br>
  &#8226; IceCast version 2 or above installed as a service. (http://www.icecast.org)<br>
  &#8226; LiveIce installed as a service. (http://star.arm.ac.uk/~spm/software/liveice.html)<br>
  &#8226; LAME 3.0 and later installed as a service and available through a global 
  path.<br>
  &#8226; Mp3 Split, installed and setup to be available through a global path. 
  (http://mp3splt.sourceforge.net/)<br>
  &#8226; Mp3 Wrap, installed and setup to be available thorough a global path. 
  (http://mp3wrap.sourceforge.net/)<br>
  &#8226; PhpPgAdmin version 2.4.x (http://phppgadmin.sourceforge.net)</p>
<h3>SysAdmin Requirements</h3>
<p>&#8226; The SysAdmin must be capable of setting up the above system<br>
  &#8226; Controlling CRON Tab jobs<br>
  &#8226; Tuning RSync to shift XBMF Files to the node.<br>
  &#8226; Maintaining the overall integrity of the system.</p>
<h2><br>
  Software Installation</h2>
<p>In order to setup a working station one needs as a prerequisite a fully functional 
  system described above. As a second step, one needs to install a copy of SelfAdmin 
  (version 3 or above) which will be the primary tool for user management.</p>
<h3>Setting Up SADM</h3>
<h4>Step 1 &#8211; preparing the database</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; Create a new database called &#8220;sadm&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Step 2 &#8211; preparing the web-end</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; Either, create a virtual host on your web server, or just use a subdir 
    on the main host and upload the whole sadm distribution into that dir.<br>
    &#8226; Set chmod 777 on the &#8220;templates_c&#8221; and &#8220;cache&#8221; 
    directories within the sadm distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Step 3 &#8211; configuring sadm</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; Open the file install.php in your web-browser and fill in all the 
    appropriate values.<br>
    &#8226; After the installation script has been executed you will be able to 
    login into sadm with the default user/password combination which is admin:admin</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><br>
  Setting Up the Station</h3>
<h4>Step 1 &#8211; preparing the database</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; Create a new database called &#8220;sotfstation&#8221;<br>
    &#8226; Execute the file station.sql found in the station distribution. This 
    will setup the whole database structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Step 2 &#8211; preparing the web-end</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">&#8226; Either, create a virtual host on your web server, or 
    just use a subdir on the main host and upload the whole station distribution 
    into that dir.<br>
    &#8226; Set chmod 777 on the &#8220;templates_c&#8221;, &#8220;progs&#8221;, 
    &#8220;sync&#8221; and &#8220;uncutaudio&#8221; directories within the station 
    distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Step 3 &#8211; configuring the station</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; Edit the file config.temp.php and fill in all the appropriate database 
    access parameters and paths. The minimum set of configuration parameters is: 
    SADM Database Access Parameters, Station Database Access Parameters, SADM 
    User Group (default 1), web path to station.<br>
    &#8226; Save the file as config.inc.php<br>
    &#8226; The station web-end is now accessible from the web browser with a 
    default user/password combination admin:admin</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Step 4 &#8211; preparing live-audio recording</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>//not yet fully described. </p>
  <p>&#8226; Uses LiveIce to record a whole day of audio into the station subdir 
    &#8220;uncutaudio&#8221; in the format YYYYMMDD_lo.mp3</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Step 5 &#8211; CRON Tab jobs</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; The whole day recordings need to be cut into smaller mp3s as soon 
    as the day feed is available. Ideally, the script cutter.php has to be run 
    at 4 o&#8217;clock every morning. It will cut the audio for the day before.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Step 6 &#8211; Communication with the node</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; Obtain a station ID from the nearest node and define this ID in your 
    config.inc.php file. Also obtain RSync access data to the nearest node.<br>
    &#8226; Now, all the files that are to be shifted to the node incoming directory 
    reside in the &#8220;sync&#8221; subfolder of the station distribution. As 
    soon as the synchronization process is complete, the files have to be deleted 
    by rsync, such that they are marked as published in the local database. <br>
  </p>
