<h1>1<a name="1" id="1"></a>) General architecture of StreamOnTheFly</h1>
<h2>1.1<a name="11" id="11"></a>) Node</h2>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>A node is the main service provider in the StreamOnTheFly network. It is basically 
  a digital library, enhanced by streaming and other radio-centered functionalities. 
  A node:</p>
<ul>
  <li>archives radio shows </li>
  <li>provides transparent search facilities in the node network 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>provides streaming and remote streaming facilities for listeners </li>
  <li>collects feedback and statistics on radio shows </li>
  <li>cooperates with other nodes and portals </li>
</ul>
<p>Nodes are transparently organized into a etwork. All nodes have metadata about 
  all radio shows and stations in the network. Nodes communicate with each other 
  to keep their local database up-to-date. </p>
<h2>1.2<a name="stations" id="stations"></a>) Station</h2>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>A station is archived at a single node, while it is searchable and browseable 
  by all nodes in the network. Each station has admins and editors. Admins may 
  change logos and jingles and manage all data, while editors can upload shows 
  and manage their own data.<br />
  <a href="#8">more Infos about the stations here</a>
</p>
<h2>1.3<a name="13" id="13"></a>) Metadata</h2>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>For each radio show a set of metadata is required from the editors (title, 
  keywords, length, etc.). The set of metadata elements is to be agreed within 
  the radio community. A recommendation for XML-based storage and exchange of 
  these metadata has also been prepared, see <a href="http://soma-dev.sourceforge.net">SOMA</a> 
  and <a href="http://sotf.dsd.sztaki.hu/XBMF.pdf">XBMF</a>. </p>
<h2>1.4<a name="14" id="14"></a>) Portals</h2>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>Portals are loosely coupled with nodes. A portal can embed radio shows manually 
  or automatically into its content. Streaming of these shows is done by the node, 
  and feedback about the show is propagated back to the node. You can try out 
  all of these tools at our demo <a href="http://sotf.dsd.sztaki.hu/">site</a>. 
</p>
<hr size="1" />
<h1>2<a name="2" id="2"></a>) Interface Overview </h1>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>The Interface of StreamOnTheFly is devided into four sections. <br />
  <strong>The Header:</strong> In the top area of the interface, SOTF provides 
  you with the possibility to change the interface language. This setting does 
  not change the content language itself. It just changes the wording in the interface. 
  Right now one can choose between English, French, Hungarian, and German.</p>
<p><strong>The Main Menu:</strong> Below this section you find the main menu of 
  SOTF. Depending on your permissions, you get different menu items. (The possible 
  menu items and their functions are described below.)</p>
<p><strong>Left Section:</strong> This section is separated into 3 boxes: Login/Personal, 
  Statistics about the node network, My Playlist (if you created one), and the 
  contact data of the running node.</p>
<p><strong>Middle Section:</strong> In this area SOTF shows you the actual content 
  in a listing. You will see the last 10 entries of content.</p>
<p><strong>Right Section:</strong> Like the left part, the right area is divided 
  into boxes: first, you find a shortcut to the complex search engine; in the 
  second box you can choose between the stations connected to the node network 
  to get their content only. In the last box, SOTF displays the topic ontology 
  and shows you a number of programmes related to the topic.</p>
<p><img src="images/interface_overview1.jpg" width="786" height="407" /></p>
<p class="abb"><em>Abb.: The SOTF main interface</em></p>
<hr size="1" />
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>3<a name="register" id="register"></a>) Registration / Preferences</h1>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>SOTF offers all users free registration for personalized features in the node 
  network. To reach the registration interface, click the 'register' link below 
  the login section (left) in the main interface. You will have to provide some 
  basic information:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr> 
    <td width="60%"><p><img src="images/registration.jpg" width="465" height="187" /></p>
      <p class="abb"><em>Abb: Registration Form </em></p></td>
    <td width="40%" valign="middle">The 'preferences' section is used for authenticated 
      users to change their personal settings. It offers the same options as the 
      registration form. Just click the 'Preferences' item in the main menu to 
      access this interface. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<hr size="1" />
<h1>4<a name="advsearch" id="advsearch"></a>) The Search Engine</h1>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
SOTF provides you with several different searching tools. The search function 
in the right section of the interface is a very basic version, but there is also 
a very complex search engine with a graphical interface that allows you to generate 
SQL statements by which you can search the database for relevant entries. SOTF 
also allows you to search for topics and stations directly from the main interface. 
<h2>4.1<a name="41" id="41"></a>) Easy Search</h2>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>In the right section of the main interface you will find a box marked &#8220;Search&#8221;. 
  Enter your search keywords here and choose a language to qualify the search 
  results. Of course you can also leave the language the way it is and search 
  without restrictions. In the image below you see the results of an easy search 
  for the keyword 'tabuk':</p>
<p><img src="images/easy_search_result.jpg" width="802" height="349" /></p>
<p class="abb"><em>Abb:Easy search results</em></p>
<p>Inside the search results interface you can redefine your queries by displaying 
  the keywords you used. The results are displayed in pages with 10 items each. 
  You can switch between the pages in both directions.</p>
<h2>4.2<a name="42" id="42"></a>) Search for Content of Stations</h2>
<a href="#top">[top]</a><br />
<p>The box marked as &#8220;Stations&#8221; is responsible for the station search 
  in the SOTF network. Choose a station, and for a result you will get all data 
  about this station, the provided series, and all programmes related to this 
  station. As usual, the result items are displayed in pages with 10 items. </p>
<h2>4.3<a name="43" id="43"></a>) Search for Topics</h2>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p><br />
  SOTF provides a general ontology to categorise and organise programmes. For 
  a fast search on topics you can just click on one of the main-topics in the 
  right section of the main interface. The number in brackets states the amount 
  of programmes related to one of the chosen sub-topics. If you mouseclick on 
  one of the main topics listed in this box, you will get an interface with the 
  sub-topics and the programmes directly related to the main topic. The interface 
  creates a frameset to display the results and the available topics in one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/search_topics.jpg" width="802" height="419" /></p>
<p class="abb"><em>Abb:Results from Topic Search</em></p>
<p>In the left section of the interface you see the entire listing of topics currently 
  available. At the top end of this listing you can choose the topics you want. 
  Click the [x] to switch back to frameless view. In the right section you see 
  the main topic you have chosen and all sub-topics related to it. In brackets 
  you see the number of programmes associated with this sub-topic. Click on an 
  entry to get a list of relevant programmes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.4<a name="44" id="44"></a>) Advanced Search Engine</h2>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p><br />
  You access the advanced search engine by a mouseclick on &#8220;search&#8221; 
  in the main menu. This interface provides you with a way to create a complex 
  SQL (structured query language) statement to run it against the node network. 
  You can redefine, store, and manage all the queries you created. </p>
<p><img src="images/advanced_search.jpg" width="814" height="406" /></p>
<span class="abb"><em>Abb: Advanced Search Engine</em> </span> 
<h3>4.4.1<a name="441" id="441"></a>) How queries work</h3>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>This is the most complex part of the SOTF interface, and it contains a lot 
  of technical terms. However, it should be easy to go through this page if you 
  are generally familiar with the terminology, syntax, and basic functions of 
  SQL.<br />
  In the first part you see the actual query for this search. You can add and 
  remove directives using the '+' and the '-' button. The search displayed in 
  this example would do the following:<br />
  First, it would collect all programmes related to the genre 'Music'. The next 
  statement is connected to this result and adds a new clause using 'AND'. There 
  are two ways to connect the statements: 'AND' and 'OR'. The connector AND would 
  mean that both clauses needs to be true. OR would mean that any one of the connected 
  statements needs to be true. Next in the example is the entry date. As you see, 
  there are two statements under this name without connector. In the SOTF interface, 
  OR is not displayed! The search would include all items with an entry date &quot;2004-07-17&quot; 
  or &quot;2004-07-22&quot;. In addition, the abstract of the item needs to contain 
  the keywords 'interview' and 'tarbuk'. At the end of the query, one would get 
  a result including all programmes where this query has &quot;true&quot; for 
  a result.</p>
<h3>4.4.2<a name="442" id="442"></a>) Create a new query</h3>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<br />
On starting a new query you see 'Your query is empty' in the top section. Below 
you have three boxes: 
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr bordercolor="0"> 
    <td width="33%"><strong>Add term to the query</strong></td>
    <td width="67%">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bordercolor="0"> 
    <td><img src="images/create_query_1.jpg" width="254" height="153" /></td>
    <td valign="top">The first (left) box is used to add a new term to the query 
      or to create a new query. The terms AND and OR are the logical connectors 
      between your statements. Choose the field you want to search and add it 
      to your query using the AND or OR statement.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bordercolor="0"> 
    <td><strong>Run query</strong></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bordercolor="0"> 
    <td><img src="images/create_query_2.jpg" width="337" height="140" /></td>
    <td valign="top">In the second (middle) box you can set choose two of the 
      available terms by which to sort the results. Desc stands for &quot;descending&quot;. 
      The default sorting order is ascending.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bordercolor="0"> 
    <td><strong>Manage your queries</strong></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bordercolor="0"> 
    <td><img src="images/create_query_3.jpg" width="301" height="139" /></td>
    <td valign="top">In the third (right) box you can manage your queries. You 
      can save the query by a given name and reload it later. You can set a query 
      as default to get the results displayed when you return to the node network.</td>
  </tr>

<h1>5<a name="5" id="5"></a>) The Programme Interface</h1>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>As we have seen, you can access the programmes by different ways. You can search 
  using different search engines or you can just click on the programme items 
  on the start page. In the interface of a programme you get all the meta-information, 
  some additional data such as images, documents, and links, and the actual content 
  itself. Here you can also upload the programme to your personal SOTF portal 
  or add it to your playlist. You can also access feedback and statistics relevant 
  to the programme. Most of this interface should be self-explanatory. </p>
<h2>5.1<a name="51" id="51"></a>) The content of a programme</h2>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p><img src="images/programm_content.jpg" width="315" height="128" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left" /></p>
<p>This is the content section of a programme. SOTF offers different quality levels 
  on all programmes (depending on configuration). You can download the files or 
  directly add them to the playlist of your mp3/ogg player. Depending on the configuration, 
  the node creates mp3 or/and ogg files. In the listing you see the quality level, 
  the type, and the duration of the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5.2<a name="52" id="52"></a>) Feedback and Statistics</h2>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>This is the last part in the programme interface. You see the feedback and 
  statistics about the files. You can rate this programme, put it into your playlist 
  and/or upload the programme to your portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/programm_feedback.jpg" width="914" height="243" /></p>
<p><span class="abb"><em>Abb: Feedbacks and Statistics</em> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<hr size="1" />
<h2>6<a name="playlist" id="playlist"></a>) My Playlist</h2>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>This feature is very useful for users who want to listen to several audio files 
  at once. It is only available to registered users. As we have seen in the programme 
  interface, you can add programmes to your playlist. You get the results in the 
  left section of the main interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/programm_playlist.jpg" width="956" height="360" /></p>
<p class="abb"><em>Abb: My Playlist</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will find the main information about the programmes in your playlist. The 
  interface provides you with links to the programme interface. We you click the 
  speaker symbol on the right, your local mp3 player should play the sound (depending 
  on your local settings). You can select several items and use the button 'play 
  selected' to send all the files to your player. Also, you can send the selected 
  items to your portal (if you have created one). You can change the order of 
  your playlist items using the 'Change Order' button. It offers you a popup window 
  in which you can move the items up and down according to your needs.</p>
<hr size="1" />
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>7<a name="7" id="7"></a>) RSS and PODCAST</h1>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>SOTF offers RSS Feeds and PODCAST structures for all content items and lists. 
  Just click on the link in the top right area of the interface. You can use this 
  feature to connect the SOTF node with other software such as RSS readers and 
  applications which are able to use RSS Feeds. <br />
  A special case of RSS is the PODCAST feature. This makes it possible to connect 
  SOTF series and programmes to the podcast network. Just click on the respective 
  links to get the RSS Feeds returned in your browser. You can use this links 
  for usage in other applications.<br />
</p>
<hr size="1" />
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h1>8<a name="8" id="8"></a>) Stations in the Network </h1>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>The Station is connected to a single node. Since SOTF is a node network, one 
  can browse and search all content coming from a certain station through all 
  other nodes in the network. A station has administrators and editors. Administrators 
  are able to edit metadata, upload logos and administrate all programmes of the 
  station. The editors are responsible for the programmes and are able to edit/upload 
  data for programmes. <br />
  The content of a station generally is structured in programmes and series. A 
  series (in these terms) is a format for programmes with changing but similar 
  content, usually broadcast at a specific time each day or week. A series links 
  individual programmes. (The format is defined by the broadcasting stations themselves 
  and must therefore not fit this description exactly). The actual programmes 
  in a series are the broadcastings (including audio files).<br />
  Click on 'Stations' in the main menu to get a list of all stations connected 
  to the node network. In the top section of this interface you can change the 
  order of the displayed stations and set filters on languages. Apart from these 
  possibilities you find the paging buttons. As usual, SOTF returns you 10 items 
  per page. You can scroll through the pages using this buttons.<br />
  In the result list you get a list of series connected to this station together 
  with some meta-information. The number in brackets states the number of programmes 
  included. Below the series you get the list of programmes. Again, you get ten 
  items displayed per page &#8211; please browse through the pages to get a full 
  overview.<br />
</p>
<hr size="1" />
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h1>9<a name="topicSearch" id="topicSearch"></a>) Topics</h1>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>Click on 'Topics' in the main menu to get a full list of topics and their related 
  programmes.<br />
  Topics in SOTF are a sort of ontology to structure programmes by their content. 
  There are two subject trees available: 'SOTF general topic tree' and 'SOMA metadata 
  version 1'.</p>
<p>As we have already seen in the search section of this document, you get a split 
  interface. In the left section you see the topic tree with all sub-topics and 
  the number of related programmes. In the right part you get a list of sub-topics. 
  When you click the sub-topics, SOTF returns you a list of related programmes.<br />
<a href="#43">how to search for topics </a></p>

<hr size="1" />
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h1>10<a name="editor" id="editor"></a>) Editor´s Console</h1>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>
<p>In the Editor&acute;s Console station editors can upload files per FTP or HTTP, and add appropriate metadata. </p>
<p><strong>UPLOAD VIA FTP:</strong><br />
  Much faster than HTTP - Upload, but needs an extra client, like SmartFTP (<a href="http://www.smartftp.com" target="_blank">download</a>). Another advantage is the resumability of uploads.</p>
<p>To access your personal SOTF directory, use the URL of your node and type in your personal access data in the FTP client. </p>
<p><strong>UPLOAD VIA HTTP:</strong> (use link &quot;Manage your files&quot;) <br />
Comfortable web interface  for adding and deleting files (no extra software required), but may cause problems when transferring larger files. </p>
