INSTALLATION

- Check that the PHP scripts in node/www directory can be run by your
  web server.

- Copy node/www/config.inc.php.template into node/www/config.inc.php ,
  and edit it according to your local settings. 
  IMPORTANT: The nodeId is a number between 1 and 999. You should ask
  the approval for your node id from the node network, in case of node
  id clash you have to reinstall the database!

- Run node/www/install/install.php from your browser.

- After a successful install login as admin 

- Go to 'Stations' to create the first station

- Go to 'Admin' menu to join the node network

- Run node/www/cron.php periodically for housekeeping
  You can do this for example with a cron job similar to this:
  0      *       *       *       *       /usr/bin/wget -q -t 1 -O /dev/null http://<YOUR_NODE_URL>/cron.php

NOTES

On Apache 2 you have to set 'AcceptPathInfo on', otherwise listening
to streams, viewing images and donwloading files will not work!

After the installation completed you may want to protect the
node/www/install subdir from unauthorized access.

We strongly suggest to set register_globals off in PHP.

Uploading large audio files to the node via web will not work if you
don't raise upload_max_filesize and post_max_size in PHP!

User sessions expire after the time defined for PHP, and users have to
log in again! You can set the session timeout for logged in users in
php.ini or in Apache via httpd.conf or .htaccess files. See
session.cookie_lifetime and session.gc_maxlifetime in PHP manual.

It is not recommended to put this directory structure under the root
directory of the web server (e.g. htdocs), because then anyone might
be able to download files which you don't want to be publicly
accessible. Therefore you may create a symbolic link from htdocs for
the www subdir, thus making accessible only a controlled part of the
directory structure through the web.

If you are updating the source code from CVS, please be sure that the
setting 'Check for changed Smarty templates and recompile them' is set
on the bottom of the admin page.  You can also tune some
logging/debugging options of the server at the same place.

If you have an older installation, check code/doc/update.sql for
changes in database structure.
